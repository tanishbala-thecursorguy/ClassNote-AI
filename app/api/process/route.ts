// This file is for Next.js API routes but we're using Vite
// The actual API functionality is in the backend/main.py file
// This file is kept for reference but is disabled for Vite builds

/*
Note: This Next.js API route file has been disabled because this project uses Vite.
The equivalent functionality is implemented in:
- backend/main.py (FastAPI backend)
- src/services/api.ts (Frontend API client)

To use this functionality, run the backend server with:
cd backend && python main.py

The backend provides these endpoints:
- POST /transcribe - Audio transcription
- POST /enhance - Text enhancement
- POST /summarize - Text summarization
- POST /key-points - Key point extraction
- POST /study-guide - Study guide generation
- POST /quiz - Quiz generation
- GET /health - Health check
